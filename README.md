# NLP-motivated-political-EDA
Using NLTK I look to analyze the sentiment of various politicians tweets across various topics

I'm currently in the process of evolving this project into an LDA model.  My current focus is
finding ways to get better topic coherence to make the analysis more fruitful.  I've also been 
exploring ways to turn this model into a time series analysis.  I think the ability to track
a politicians stance over time can give valuable insight.
